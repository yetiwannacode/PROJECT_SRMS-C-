# 🎓 Student Record Management System in C

A feature-rich **console-based application** built in **C** to manage student records efficiently using **linked lists** and **file handling**. This project demonstrates hands-on expertise in dynamic memory management, modular programming, and data persistence — all built from scratch without external libraries.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 Add new student records
- 🔍 Search students by roll number
- ✏️ Edit student details (with optional blank fields)
- 🗑️ Delete records with safety checks
- 🏆 View student **rankings** sorted by marks
- 🧠 Detect duplicate roll numbers and warn about duplicate names
- 💾 Save and Load student data using persistent file storage
- 📁 Modular file structure with `.c` and `.h` separation

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- 🧠 C Programming (structs, pointers, dynamic memory)
- 📚 Linked Lists (manual memory management)
- 💽 File I/O (`fopen`, `fscanf`, `fprintf`, `fclose`)
- 🧩 Modular design principles
- 🧪 Input validation & edge case handling
